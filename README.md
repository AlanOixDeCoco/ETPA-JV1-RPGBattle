# ETPA-JV1-RPGBattle

This project is the first one of my second degree (at the ETPA) programmation class, it is about scripting/coding in:
- HTML/CSS for the visual part
- JS for the game logic

It is a basic RPG turn based combat scene, in which you can attack a desired ennemy, defend your team or use special attacks character after character, before being targeted by the ennemies.

Before looking at my code I recommend you enjoying a [first game][game_url] on desktop/mobile thanks to the responsive flexbox design!
